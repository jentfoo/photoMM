# photoMM
Tool to analyze a number of jpg's and analyze the EXIF data to determine what MM the photo was shot with.  It then generalizes what lens would have accomidated most photos.

This project is focused on some personal goals of mine, not currently very generalized.  If this is useful for other people, please file an issue and I can put some effort into it.
